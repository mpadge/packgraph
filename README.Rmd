Examine and Analyse Function Call Graphs of R Packages. Mostly derived from
functionality provided by the [`r-lib/pkgapi`
package](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgapi), which is not on CRAN and must first
be installed with
```{r pkgapi, eval = FALSE}
source("https://install-github.me/r-lib/pkgapi")
```
(or `remotes::install_github()` will also work).
